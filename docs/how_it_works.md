# How Poker Drills Work

## Train Your Poker Brain in 60 Seconds a Day

Every drill gives you a real poker hand, a real decision, and a clear explanation of the right move. No fluff. No guessing. Just hands, choices, and instant feedback that makes you a better player.

## How It Works

### 1. Pick a Skill to Practice

Choose from 16 poker situations that cover every street and every decision type:

- **Before the flop** -- Should you raise, call, or fold? When should you squeeze? How do you defend your big blind?
- **On the flop** -- Is this a good spot to bet? Should you check-raise? Can you semi-bluff with a draw?
- **On the turn** -- Do you fire a second barrel? When do you probe bet? Should you delay your c-bet?
- **On the river** -- Is this a value bet or a bluff? Should you call or fold facing a big bet?
- **Tournaments** -- Push or fold? How does ICM pressure change your decisions?

### 2. See a Real Hand

You get dealt real cards on a real board. The pot size, stack sizes, and positions are all set up like a genuine poker hand. Nothing is fake or simplified -- these are the exact situations you face at the table.

### 3. Make Your Choice

Every drill gives you 2-4 options. Only one is correct. Pick the action you think is best.

### 4. Learn Why

Hit or miss, you get a full explanation for every option -- not just the right answer, but why the other choices are wrong. This is where the real learning happens. You start to see patterns and think like a winning player.

## Features That Help You Improve

### Adaptive Difficulty

The system watches how you play and adjusts. Getting hands right? It moves you up to harder spots with trickier stack sizes and tougher decisions. Struggling? It dials things back so you can build a solid foundation first.

**Three levels:**
- **Beginner** -- Standard stacks, clear-cut decisions. Learn the fundamentals.
- **Intermediate** -- Mixed stack depths, closer decisions. Sharpen your edge.
- **Advanced** -- Short stacks, deep stacks, thin value spots, and tricky bluffs. Play like a pro.

### Plain English or Pro Mode

New to poker? Every drill is written in simple, everyday language. No jargon, no confusing abbreviations.

Ready for the real thing? Switch to Technical mode and get the same drills with proper poker terminology -- SPR, EV, fold equity, range advantage, and more. Learn the language the pros use.

### Track Your Progress

See exactly where you are strong and where you need work:

- **Mastery tiers** for every topic -- from Unstarted all the way to Mastered
- **Per-branch tracking** -- know which specific situations trip you up
- **Lifetime score** -- watch your overall skill grow over time

### Endless Variety

Every drill is randomly generated from real card combinations. With over a trillion possible scenarios, you will never see the same hand twice. Practice as much as you want without running out of material.

### Instant Feedback

No waiting. No video to sit through. Make your choice and immediately see the result with a clear, detailed explanation. Learn in seconds, not hours.
